I love pizza. 
This pizza tastes like garbage. 
Tacos are better than pizza.
I enjoy making pizza.
I get sad when pizza falls on the ground.
Robots do not eat pizza.
I do not like movies.
I enjoy art films in foreign languages.
The movie was very sad.
The violence was sensational.
The villagers were burned to a crisp. 
In the end, everyone was very happy with the outcome.
